Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : A platform to - 1) Detect Accident <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Automatically call for Rescue services <br>

### Problem statement
<hr>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As per statistics, the main reason for 90% of cases fail is late communication. If there is proper communication, many lives would have been saved. Traffic accidents worldwide trigger a significant number of deaths. A large number of deaths and injuries caused by road traffic collisions. Family members or emergency services are not contacted in a timely manner. The most common cause of death after an accident is a shortage of first-aid treatment due to emergency responders failing to receive reports about the accident in a timely manner. This causes a delay in emergency care response time, which may result in a person's death or serious injury. So, we are trying to build a device that will communicate instantly to the nearest hospital, police station and also automatically sends notification regarding the accident to respective vehicle insurance vendor for further insurance claiming process.

### Solution
<hr>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am building a device, which can immediately detect, that the accident has happened, and it will automatically communicate to a nearby hospital for rescue service, and a nearby police station for intimation of the accident, with the details of location coordinates, vehicle number, etc. Also, notification will be sent to the insurance vendor regarding the accident, along with the vehicle's detail and owner's detail for the insurance claim. Automatically, a unique link will be sent to the owner's registered mobile number through SMS and WhatsApp. In this link, the user can upload the necessary documents like a driving license, FIR copy, bill copies of the car service, and medical expenses for further process of claiming insurance. After verification of submitted documents by the user, the insurance company will credit the amount to the user's bank account.
